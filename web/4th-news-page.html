    <p>
        The Andromeda constellation consists of 16 stars visible in the northern sky. Named by ancient Greeks after the mythological Andromeda princess, the constellation contains the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest full-fledged galaxy to our own Milky Way.

        Andromeda is one of 48 constellations described by the Ancient Greek astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in 150 AD in his famous work "The Almagest."

        Ptolemy's list was the first official description of constellations, although these stellar groupings had been known to ancient Greeks, Babylonians, Egyptians and other cultures, who frequently saw them as embodiments of their mythical figures.

        Andromeda is one of the largest of Ptolemy's constellations.

        Another 40 constellations were added to Ptolemy's tally over the centuries. Many of these additions reside in the southern sky, which was not visible to Ptolemy, who spent most of his life in Egypt.

        Today, Andromeda is the 19th largest of the 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.

    <h4>When to observe the Andromeda constellation</h4>

    <p>The Andromeda constellation can be best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, as it moves lower toward the horizon the farther south you stand. At about 40 degrees south latitude it disappears completely, according to EarthSky. (The 40th parallel south lies just below the southern tips of Africa and Australia and crosses the southernmost part of South America).

        In the Northern Hemisphere, Andromeda is best observed from August to February, while in the Southern Hemisphere, the visibility period is much shorter, from October to December, according to PlanetGuide.

        From August to September, in the Northern Hemisphere, Andromeda emerges on the north-eastern horizon at about 10 p.m. local time, then gradually rises
